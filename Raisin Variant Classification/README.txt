In this study, machine vision system was developed in order to distinguish between two different variety of raisins (Kecimen and Besni) grown in Turkey. 
Firstly, a total of 900 pieces raisin grains were obtained, from an equal number of both varieties. These images were subjected to various preprocessing steps and 7 morphological feature extraction operations were performed using image processing techniques.
In addition, minimum, mean, maximum and standard deviation statistical information was calculated for each feature.
